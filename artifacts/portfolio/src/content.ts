        shortDescription: "A six-month multimedia storytelling project about Bandung's Gen Z creative workers navigating a shrinking job market.",
        detailDescription: "Serabutan started from a question our team kept coming back to: what actually happens to young creative workers in Bandung when the formal job market stops working for them? We were not just talking about freelancers by choice. We were talking about people who became freelancers because they got laid off, could not find stable work, or needed to piece together multiple gigs just to cover rent.\n\nAs editor and content overseer for the entire six months, my job was to make sure every story we produced was honest, specific, and structurally sound. That meant going through the data first, BPS unemployment figures, Disnaker records, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan statistics, before we even started assigning stories. I wanted every piece to be grounded in something real, not just vibes about the gig economy.\n\nOn the editorial side, I edited scripts to fit a sharp narrative style, clear angle, no unnecessary detours, the kind of writing that respects the reader's time. I also directed the video feature production and designed the prototype website for Serabutan on Figma, which served as the main container for the whole multimedia project.\n\nThe part I found hardest was maintaining consistency across a team with different writing backgrounds over six months. Some people write academically, some write casually, and getting everyone to land in the same voice without killing their individual style took a lot of back-and-forth. I think that taught me more about editing than any single technique could.",

        shortDescription: "A field-reported opinion piece on the unresolved social and economic fallout from the Jatigede Dam relocation in Sumedang, West Java.",
        detailDescription: "The Jatigede Dam has been operational for over a decade. The government calls it a success. The residents who were relocated to build it have a different story.\n\nI went to Sumedang as part of my advocacy journalism course, initially to do research. But once I was there and started talking to people, the gap between the official narrative and what residents were actually living through was impossible to ignore. I interviewed Om Engkus Hadi, a former farmer who now works as a boat operator at Tanjung Duriat tourism site. On a good day he makes some money. On most days he makes nothing. He told me the boats are falling apart and no one helps with repairs. He fixes them out of his own pocket because that is the only livelihood he has left.\n\nI also interviewed the site manager, who spoke about training programs and community empowerment initiatives. Both accounts were true in their own way, which made the story more complicated and more important to tell carefully.\n\nThe piece I wrote argues that infrastructure development cannot be declared a success just because the dam is functioning. Success should be measured by whether the people who sacrificed their land and homes have genuinely recovered. In the case of Jatigede, they have not.\n\nThis was the first time I reported a story where I felt the weight of getting it right. These are real people whose names appear in the article. That responsibility changed how I approach sourcing and verification.",

        shortDescription: "An AI-powered platform that checks whether a news article complies with Indonesia's Press Code of Ethics.",
        detailDescription: "Ethicheck came out of a problem we kept noticing in Indonesian online media. Speed was consistently winning over accuracy. Articles were getting published with unverified sources, sensational headlines, and thin attribution, and most of the time nothing happened because there was no accessible tool for readers or editors to flag these issues against the actual code of ethics.\n\nThe platform we built checks articles against the Kode Etik Jurnalistik, the Press Law, and Pedoman Pemberitaan Media Siber automatically. But beyond the checker function, we also built in an interactive education module with quizzes and scenarios, because we thought it was important that people understand why each ethical standard exists, not just whether they violated it.\n\nMy contribution sat at the intersection of journalism knowledge and product thinking. I helped research the cases of ethical violations that informed the platform's evaluation criteria, and worked on how the feedback should be framed so it was useful rather than just judgmental.\n\nWhat I found interesting about this project was that it forced me to think about journalism ethics not as a list of rules to memorize but as a set of principles that have real consequences when ignored.",

It is a discipline I now apply when writing scripts for video, because the two are more connected than they seem.",
